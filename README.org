  Formally, the lambda caluclus can be described by the following BNF grammar:
  #+begin_src 
  expr = var
       | lambda var . expr
       | (expr expr)
  #+end_src

Start enumerating bindings at the outermost scope.

When new variables are bound in the inner scopes then the largest binding in scope gets incremented.

This produces the variable names at each level.
